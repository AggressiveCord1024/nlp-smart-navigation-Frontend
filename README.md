# 🚀 Frontend (Next.js)  

This is the frontend submodule for the project, built with **Next.js** and **Bootstrap** for a responsive UI.

## 📌 Getting Started  

### 1️⃣ Cloning the Repository  
#### Note: If you cloned the main repository using the **`--recursive`** flag, this submodule is already included. **No need to clone it separately!**  

However, if you forgot to use **`--recursive`**, initialize the submodule manually:  
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### **<p align="center">🔹 OR 🔹</p>**

If you're only working on the Frontend, simply clone and start:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karan-panda/nlp-smart-navigation-Frontend
cd nlp-smart-navigation-Frontend
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Development Server
```
npm run dev
```

### 4️⃣ Ensure the Backend API is Running
As the Frontend interacts with the Flask API that uses Sentence Transformers for NLP-based navigation.
